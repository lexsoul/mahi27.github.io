Hola! Bonjour! Hello! Namaste!
I’m Mahitha, currently pursuing my Masters in Business Analytics at University of Cincinnati.
I'm passionate about applying machine learning to drive innovation and have been living the dream for two years now. I can build ML models both in R and Python, develop dashboards and amazing visualizations using R-shiny and JS libraries, tell stories using Tableau and manage data using SQL. Currently, I’m picking up other tools like SAS and Hadoop.

If you’re looking to collaborate on future projects, willing to hire me (part-time/full-time), give feedback or need further information, feel free to drop in a mail at mahitasree@gmail.com. I'm always open to new opportunities
